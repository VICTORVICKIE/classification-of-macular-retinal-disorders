### Etiologic Classification of Macular Edema Using Convolutional Neural Networks & Random Forest in Optical Coherence Tomography Scans dataset

```
    This Project employs CNN Architecture for Feature Extraction of Medical Scans. 
    It consists of an encoder blocks that downsample the feature maps, and traditional machine learning algorithm that predicts based on features.


    For images multi-classification between all diseases dataset folder contains all images resized into 256 * 256, and in both divided among training, 
    test and augmented sets for:

    - Control
    - DME
    - AMD
    - RVO
```
